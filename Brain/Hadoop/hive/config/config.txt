set dfs.blocksize;
set parquet.block.size; -> undefine because I'm using the default file format as text file format
set hive.default.fileformat;
set hive.metastore.warehouse.dir;

set hive.groupby.orderby.position.alias=true; 
    chỉ dùng cho order by, bình thường là order by tenCot, nhưng nếu set thành true thì chỉ cần là order by (cột thứ mấy trong bảng)

set mapred.reduce.tasks=1; 
    This property is to set the number of reducers to be used in a job. By default, Hive chooses the number of reducers to be used in a job by itself, considering various factors, like nature of command and amount of data to be processed.

set hive.exec.reducers.bytes.per.reducer=25600000;
    This property specifies the number of bytes that each reducer should be given. By default, it is 256 MB. Now suppose, if I have 512 MB of data, then according to this property, two reducers will be used, because 256 MB of data will be given to one reducer, and the next reducer will be given 256 MB

set hive.exec.reducers.max;
    By default, its value is 1009. This property is to restrict(hạn chế) the maximum number of reducers to be used in a job.

set mapred.map.tasks.speculative.execution".
    by default it is true. If you know that your job will be slow or your task will be slow due to the complex algorithms in it, then you can make this property to false to avoid the redundancy(dư thừa) of tasks.

set mapred.reduce.tasks.speculative.execution;
    cùng tác dụng vs cái mapred.map.tasks.speculative.execution

set hive.enforce.bucketing;
    This property should set to be true if you want your table data to be stored in buckets.
