essentially a reference type is a type where if you copy it you don't really copy it,

the object in memory will stay the same, you just copied the address, so the pointer pointing at that object.

I add square brackets to create a new array and then three dots to take all the elements of another array,

the posts array here, pull them out of that array and add them to this new array.

So I'm creating a new array with the old objects and therefore this array has been copied. 

Important, not the objects, these are still the old objects but at least the array is copied,

so if I now edit this array, if I add new elements or remove elements from within another component,

this will not work,

this will not affect my original array here.
