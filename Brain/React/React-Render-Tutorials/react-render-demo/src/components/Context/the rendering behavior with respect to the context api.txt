Mô tả ảnh 'the rendering behavior with respect to the context api.png'

in this scenario let's say the initial render is completed so all the components have been rendered once now
since the count value is a state variable in the parent component
let's say we called the setcountsetter function to increment the count value 
if the count value increments the component will be flagged for re-render
we know that react starts from the root component and finds the components flagged for re-render
react says that the parent component has been flagged
when it's rendering the parent component react says that the parent component also renders a context provider
it then checks to see if the context provider has been given a new value 
since we increment the count value the context provider indeed has been given a new value (thực sự đã đc cấp 1 new value)
react will make a note to re-render all the components that consume the context value
in our example the component is child C 
so react makes its way down the component tree and when it encounters (khi nó gặp) child C it is going to re-render that component
